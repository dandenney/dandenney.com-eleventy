    <h2>Hi! I'm Dan Denney and I'm a Front-end Engineer at <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">DataCamp</a>.</h2>
    <p>That title is a bit dated. These days I'm a half-stack engineer, which is a full-stack engineer focused on half of the stack. In my case, it's the front-end half. A Front-End Full Stack Engineer, if you will.</p>

    <p class="u-fs-h3">In reality, I write <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> for a living. (And, for fun)</p>

    <h3>Remember those?</h3>
    <p>If you, too, have made many trips around the sun, then you may have seen these GIFs in action. I'm revamping the tech behind this site and the visuals, but I chose a poor time to do it. I'm right near the end of <a href="https://www.newline.co/fullstack-d3">Fullstack D3</a> so I'm trying to get back to that. However, I wanted to change back to <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a> to make some near-future projects easier.</p>
