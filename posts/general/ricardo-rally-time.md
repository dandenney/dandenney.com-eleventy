## Help Me, Help Ricardo

Ricardo Gimenes, who does all of the illustrations for Front-End Conf, is crowd funding an iPad app. [Vectorlooza](http://catarse.me/en/vectorlooza) is his take on how an illustrator app on the iPad should look and feel.

The video is entertaining and it looks like it would be a rad app. I'm a huge Ricardo fanboy, so I want to try to help with the last push for him to make his goal.

### You know you want a character...

I backed the project at a level that will reward me with 3 characters (if the project reaches its goal). I will gladly give these characters away in exchange for some social sharing.

Tweet something to promote Vectorlooza, link up [http://catarse.me/en/vectorlooza](http://catarse.me/en/vectorlooza) and include #frontendconf so I can track them.

If the project reaches its goal, I will do a random draw from those who share for the characters.
