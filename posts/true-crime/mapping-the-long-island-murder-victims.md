# Mapping the Long Island murder victims

</div>

<div class="post-body">

"The Long Island Serial Killer," aka "LISK," is a misnomer. The more that you look at Long Island from the early 90s until the 2010s, the worse it gets. [Joel Rifkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Rifkin) lived in the Hempstead area and killed at least nine, but up to seventeen people from 1989 - 1993. [Robert Shulman](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Shulman_(serial_killer)>) killed at least five people from 1991 - 1996 while living in the Hicksville area.

There is another person guilty of two murders in the early 90s, [John Bittrolff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bittrolff). While two murders don't qualify him as a serial killer, he is a suspect in a third. If he were proven guilty of that, he would meet the technical classification of three. More importantly, he wasn't connected and arrested for the two murders until 2014. There are twenty years between the last murder he is convicted of and his arrest.

## There are ten more murder victims, and one highly debated death, without answers.

While authorities have named John Bittrolff as a person of interest in the other murders, there are enough differences in them that many people believe that one to three killers are responsible for them. It's hard to know what the local authorities believe or are investigating because they release mixed messages. The Long Island Serial Killers is likely more accurate, but they only matter because we want to bring them to justice. The most important thing that we can do is find the answer to who some of the victims are and ensure that the killers of the others are apprehended, to bring the next step of recovery to their loved ones.

The map below is going to focus on specific details, mostly the location of the victims. It is essential to remember that they are people, like you and me. Their stories deserve to be told, and they have been. If you haven't yet heard the stories of the Long Island victims, I strongly recommend watching [The Killing Season](https://www.aetv.com/shows/the-killing-season), where you'll meet family and friends of many of the people mentioned below. Their stories have also been covered in podcasts, on [True Crime Garage](https://truecrimegarage.com/podcast/blog/long-island-serial-killer-04), [Thinking Sideways](http://www.thinkingsidewayspodcast.com/the-long-island-serial-killer/), [Voices from Gilgo](https://www.voicesfromgilgo.com), and on the Youtube show [BrainScratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li3jTbkhBuw&feature=youtu.be).

The sad truth is that these victims are part of a series of circumstances that are popular in unsolved homicides. These cases include lackluster police work with [criminal behavior](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/nyregion/james-burke-ex-suffolk-county-police-chief-is-sentenced.html) amongst those involved, a high-risk lifestyle that leads to gaps of time in missing person reports, and the need for public pressure to prioritize the cases.

The following is a timeline of events, with their locations, intending to show how the circumstances may be related.

        <h3>This part of the story begins on November 1, 1993</h3>
        <p>On that evening, a woman had been seen hitchhiking in East Patchogue, NY. Her name was Rita Tangredi.</p>

        <h3>Rita Tangredi's remains were found in wooded area on November 2, 1993</h3>
        <p>The details are an important part of identifying her killer: she had been beaten, strangled, a specific item of her clothing was missing, and her body was found in a distinct pose, and wood chips were used to cover her.</p>

There are many more persons of interest and/or suspects in these cases. John Bittrolff is the only one included because he is the only one with any charges against him. To be clear, the Suffolk County District Attorney has said ["There is no evidentiary or investigative link between this case and Gilgo."](https://pix11.com/2017/09/12/convicted-killer-may-be-tied-to-gilgo-beach-murders-prosecutor)

## Yet to be solved

One of the many reasons that these cases are yet to be solved is the mix of behaviors by the killer. Historically speaking, the action taken by a killer maintains some consistency and/or escalates over time. It is vital to remember that the public does not have all of the information about the crimes.

What is known is that the early victims were subjected to aggressive violence, strangled, and were left in a specific pose. The next four victims (by order of when they were found) were dismembered and discovered in multiple locations. The Gilgo Four follow a different pattern, in that they were found in a single place and were all laid to rest in a similar way. The outliers in the victims who were found in the ensuing searches are "John Doe" and "Baby Doe". "John Doe" was subject to violence, but found in a single location, and "Baby Doe" was found in a single location with no indication of violence.

The patterns changed, which only leads to questions. Was there one killer who escalated over time and then de-escalated? Or were there multiple killers acting in the same area? Multiple peole killing at the same time has happened in Long Island, as Joel Rifkin, Robert Shulman, and John Bittrolff were each killing people between 1991 and 1993. As for whether or not a single killer would change patterns significantly over time, another killer gives us some insight into that. There's a dramatization in Mindhunters of Robert Ressler's interview with Ed Kemper, where Kemper says, "It seems to me everything you know about serial killers has been gleaned from the ones who've been caught." We won't know the answers to the questions until the killer of at least one of the victims is apprehended.

If you'd like more information around the involved cases, I have compiled more details and links about [The Gilgo Four](https://www.truecrimeresearchers.com/cases/the-gilgo-four), the [Long Island Victims](https://www.truecrimeresearchers.com/cases/long-island-victims), and [Shannan Gilbert](https://www.truecrimeresearchers.com/cases/shannan-gilbert).

If you have any information about these victims, please share on the [Gilgo News tip site](https://www.gilgonews.com/SubmitATip).
