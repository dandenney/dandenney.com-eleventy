> Write an intro to a blog post about how I used AI to write this blog post, in a sarcastic tone

Oh boy, another day, another blog post. But this one is special - I didn't write it! Nope, I decided to let the robots do the work for me. Who needs human creativity and originality when you can use AI to generate content, am I right? I mean, why spend hours brainstorming and crafting your own words when you can just feed a bunch of prompts to a machine and voila, you've got yourself a blog post! So, let me tell you all about how I used AI to write this masterpiece of a blog post. Get ready to be amazed (or not).

> Write a paragraph about how I have been bearish on new technologies like NFTs, but that I'm very excited by image and text generation with AI, in a sarcastic tone

Well, look at me, the resident technophobe, finally coming around to the wonders of new technology. Who would have thought? eye roll Yes, it's true, I've been pretty bearish on the whole NFT craze lately. I mean, who needs unique, one-of-a-kind digital assets when you can just take a screenshot of it and call it a day, right? But, lo and behold, there is one area of tech that I can't help but get excited about - image and text generation with AI. Because, you know, who needs human creativity and originality when you can just train a machine to do it for you? I'm sure we'll all be replaced by robots soon enough, and I, for one, can't wait to be out of a job.

> Write a paragraph about how I used AI generated images for all of my blog posts, in a self-effacing tone

I have to admit, I'm not the most skilled artist out there. In fact, I'm pretty terrible. That's why I decided to turn to AI-generated images for all of my blog posts. I mean, why bother trying to draw something myself when I can just input a few keywords and let the algorithm do the work for me? It's not like anyone is going to be able to tell the difference, right? And let's be real, the images are probably way better than anything I could come up with on my own. It's a win-win situation, really. I get to have eye-catching visuals for my blog without having to put in any actual effort. Who knew that AI could make me look like a creative genius?

> Write a paragraph about how I'm excited for AI and I will use it for my images, but I will keep the writing personal from now on, in a light-hearted tone

As much as I love the idea of replacing myself with an AI language model and living my life as a digital ghost, I've decided to keep at least one part of my blog personal - my writing. Sure, I'll happily let a computer generate my images for me. But when it comes to the actual content of my blog, I'm going to stick with good old-fashioned human creativity. Plus, if I let a machine take over everything, what will I do with all of my free time? Learn to play the ukulele? Start a collection of novelty salt shakers? The possibilities are endless. So, for now, I'll leave the writing to myself and let the robots handle the pretty pictures. It's a match made in heaven, really.
