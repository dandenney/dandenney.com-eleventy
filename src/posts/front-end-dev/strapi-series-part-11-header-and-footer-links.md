It's time to get the data from Strapi into the components, and I'm going to try something new with that. Typically, I would request the page links data into the page as `pageLinks`, then pass `pageLinks` into the `Header` and `Footer` components. Sometimes, I would drill even further into something like a `PageLinks` component at that point. I recently watched [Un-Suck Your React Components - Composable & [Compound Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPRdY87_SH0), and I want to use the slots idea from that. 

In this case, I'm not going for fully composable since this component is focused on outputting a few links. I'm just looking to give my prop drill a rest.

The page links are currently output in 3 different ways:

```jsx
// In the Header.jsx as a div that only shows from md: on
<div className="hidden md:flex md:gap-x-6">
  <NavLink href="#features">Features</NavLink>
  <NavLink href="#testimonials">Testimonials</NavLink>
  <NavLink href="#pricing">Pricing</NavLink>
</div>

// In the Header.jsx as part of a Popover Panel
<Popover.Panel
  as="div"
  className="absolute inset-x-0 top-full mt-4 flex origin-top flex-col rounded-2xl bg-white p-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-900 shadow-xl ring-1 ring-slate-900/5"
>
  <MobileNavLink href="#features">Features</MobileNavLink>
  <MobileNavLink href="#testimonials">Testimonials</MobileNavLink>
  <MobileNavLink href="#pricing">Pricing</MobileNavLink>
  <hr className="m-2 border-slate-300/40" />
  <MobileNavLink href="/login">Sign in</MobileNavLink>
</Popover.Panel>

// In the Footer.jsx as part of a nav element
<nav className="mt-10 text-sm" aria-label="quick links">
  <div className="-my-1 flex justify-center gap-x-6">
    <NavLink href="#features">Features</NavLink>
    <NavLink href="#testimonials">Testimonials</NavLink>
    <NavLink href="#pricing">Pricing</NavLink>
  </div>
</nav> 
```

I believe that this means that I can have two slots in the `Header` and one in the `Footer`. To avoid mapping in the props, I'll make a `PageLinks` component that takes in the data as well as a `mobile` prop, to determine which component to loop.

Quick aside: how would you handle it? [@dandenney on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dandenney) if you want to share or even pop it into a [PR](https://github.com/dandenney/strapi-series-marketing) or [refactor issue](https://github.com/dandenney/strapi-series-marketing/issues) if you want. 

## The PageLinks Component

To keep this component focused on the data, I'm not going to include the parent element. I'll need to pass a fragment, but that feels cleaner than wrapping an HTML element and/or passing classes through. I may do that in the future for other components, but the simplicity here lets me avoid it.

### A Detour To Fight TypeScript

My nemesis showed its three heads as I got started making `PageLinks.tsx` because I had skipped the config part of the install. It is nice that `npx tsc` is available for that. I tried the autofix for "Cannot use JSX unless the '--jsx' flag is provided.ts(17004)" five or so times with different approaches before googling how to enable it, before I realized that was adding it to the `jsconfig` file. 

There's a bunch of options commented out in the default `tsconfig`, but not the flag it mentions and not the same as the way it's going into the `jsconfig`. 

<div class="full-to-half-bleed">

```javascript
// "jsx": "preserve", /* Specif what JSX code is generated. */
// "experimentalDecorators": true, /* Enable experimental support for legacy experimental decorators. */
// "emitDecoratorMetadata": true, /* Emit design-type metadata for decorated declarations in source files. */
// "jsxFactory": "", /* Specify the JSX factory function used when targeting React JSX emit, e.g. 'React.createElement' 
```

</div>

Luckily, I made my code changes, started the server, and there was a really nice message updating the config items for me.

<figure>

    </ul>

So close and yet so far away. The import for a component isn't working with the alias in the `tsx` files now. I had to learn a litle bit about how that works since it's always been set up in apps I've worked on. The `jsconfig` has:

```jsx
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["src/*"]
}
```
I found the `paths` in the `tsconfig` and replicated that, but then got an error about the `baseUrl` not being set. Fixing that allowed me to restart the server, start the CMS, and see links on a page as my first example. (I imported the component into the index in order to see that it was working). 

### Back To The PageLinks

With this, I have the default version looping over the existing `<NavLink>` component.

```jsx
import { NavLink } from '@/components/NavLink'
import { NavLink } from '@/components/NavLink'
import { Fragment } from 'react'

type PageLink = {
  id: number
  hash: string
  text: string
}

type PageLinks = {
  pageLinks: PageLink[]
}

export function PageLinks({ pageLinks }: PageLinks) {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      {pageLinks.map(({ id, hash, text }) => (
        <NavLink key={id} href={hash}>
          {text}
        </NavLink>
      ))}
    </Fragment>
  )
}
```

## Adding to the Header and Footer

That code above will work for two out of three uses, but the mobile nav part is going to take a refactor. It turns out that the reason that the `<MobileNavLink>` is defined in the `<Header>` file is that it uses `<Popover.Button>`, which requires having a parent of `<Popover>`. 

I can make progress, albeit with another tradeoff. Here's an example of making the change to `Header.jsx`. The file has a lot of code, so I'm only showing the necessary bits here. You can view it all in context in [the PR](https://github.com/dandenney/strapi-series-marketing/pull/7), though.

<p class="file-name"><strong>Header.jsx</strong></p>

```jsx
export function Header({ slotPageLinks }) {
  ...
  <div className="hidden md:flex md:gap-x-6">
    {slotPageLinks}
  </div>
```

The one interesting bit is I got myself into a naming dilemma. I'm mostly concerned that the data would match up as closely as possible, so I added the `slot` prefix for the component. There was another TypeScript snafu as well. The `<Header>` component would/will need a lot of type declarations, so I kept it as `jsx` for the moment. I'll figure out how I want to refactor the mobile nav part first and then do the types at that point. It is nice to be able to opt-in to TypeScript, and I partially wish I had skipped it for this series, even though it's responsive development. 

The footer is very similar, and I thought I could make it `.tsx`, but I'll have to fight the `<Container>` props types later.

<p class="file-name"><strong>Footer.jsx</strong></p>

```jsx
export function Footer({ slotPageLinks }) {
  ...
  <div className="-my-1 flex justify-center gap-x-6">
    {slotPageLinks}
  </div>
```

Importing them into the `index.jsx`, makes that file look like this:

<div class="full-to-half-bleed">

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head'
import { getPageLinks } from '@/sources/getPageLinks'
import { Footer } from '@/components/Footer'
import { Header } from '@/components/Header'
import { PageLinks } from '@/components/PageLinks'

export default function Home({ pageLinks }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>
          Be the First to Know: Join the BandCamp Launch List Today!
        </title>
        <meta
          name="description"
          content="Sign up to get notified when BandCamp's music theory courses go live and take your skills to the next level."
        />
      </Head>
      <Header 
        slotPageLinks={<PageLinks pageLinks />} 
      />
      <main></main>
      <Footer 
        slotPageLinks={<PageLinks pageLinks />} 
      />
    </>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const pageLinks = await getPageLinks()
  return {
    props: { pageLinks },
  }
}
```

</div>

I dig the approach so far in avoiding the prop drilling. I think I'll need to plan out data and component naming in the future, but I might even like having the `slot` prefix. Here's a sneak peek at the header and footer displaying the link data from Strapi.

## Blech

I tried moving the mobile nav parts out of the Header component, but it gets weird. I'll need some more practice at composition in general for thinking about how to structure a component. That's not really what this series is about, so I'm moving on and doing a little drilling. Here's [the commit](https://github.com/dandenney/strapi-series-marketing/commit/8c3645022126145abe95770c607e3f5c51a73580) for adding passing the data into the header.
