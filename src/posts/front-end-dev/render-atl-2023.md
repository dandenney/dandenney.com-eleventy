I'm at the Atlanta airport, replaying the last few days of [Render ATL](https://www.renderatl.com) in my head. They say it's "a tech conference where talent feels welcomed." If I had to describe it, I'd say, "[it's a vivrant thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYTjBhplTGY&pp=ygUNdml2cmFudCB0aGluZw%3D%3D)." I have been to a lot of conferences, but I have never experienced the energy that the people at Render brought. I'm ready to buy my ticket for [next year](https://twitter.com/ThugDebugger/status/1664770491087765504), and I highly recommend you do, too. 

## Where Tech Meets Culture

I'm not sure if that's an official slogan, but one of the emcees said it, and I think it perfectly describes what sets Render apart from other web conferences I've been to. Most emcees were not tech workers, and they all had dynamic personalities, which raised the energy for each presentation. In hindsight, I should have asked, but I imagine it helped the speakers as well. 

The event was part of Tech Week in Atlanta, so there were some evening events that were mixed with people who were and weren't attending the conference. I forgot to RSVP to Tuesday night's event, and it sold out, so I made sure to grab a spot for [The BLK Out ATL](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-blk-out-atl-tickets-631360635657) on Wednesday night. It was touted as a couple of hours of networking, followed by an R&B session. Uh, yes, please. I'm pretty shy, and I didn't know anyone at the event, but a handful of people went out of their way to make me feel welcome. The DJ was hilarious and really got the place going once the networking time was over. It turned into a packed club filled with fantastic music, which was a fabulous preview for the next few days. 

Wednesday was also workshop day and I got a great intro to Remix from [@chancethedev](https://twitter.com/chancethedev). I've been pretty curious about Remix, and this was a great way to get it explained by someone who helped build it.

## Day One

Render is a multi-track event with tracks for leadership and entrepreneurship, networking, product and project management, and web and mobile engineering. They also had a huge sponsor area and some specific chats and events around them as well. I mostly stuck to the presentations, and here's what I saw on Thursday, with a fun little takeaway for each with the help of ChatGPT.

## The Rooftop Party

I've been to some amazing conference parties, but this was on another level. Thousands of us took over the rooftop of Ponce City Market, with carnival games, mini golf, multiple DJs, and amazing views. This pic captures maybe one third of the space and crowd.

<img class="full-to-half-bleed" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtlow08pj/image/upload/f_auto,c_limit,w_686,q_auto/v1681092603/posts/IMG_7605.heic" alt="Screenshot of the Vercel UI" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtlow08pj/image/upload/f_auto,c_limit,w_686,q_auto/v1681092603/posts/IMG_7605.heic 718w, https://res.cloudinary.com/dtlow08pj/image/upload/f_auto,c_limit,w_2286,q_auto/v1681092603/posts/IMG_7605.heic 768w" />

## Day Two

In a surprising twist, I made it out of the party early enough to get some sleep and not be hung over for the morning talks. This was a new experiment and I may try it again! 🤪

## Ending With a Concert

The "after party" was a full [Kaytranada](https://www.kaytranada.com) concert in the Historic Fourth Ward Skatepark. This was also part of tech week and open to the public, which made for a huge celebration. Check this out....

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Such a great way to end the conference!<br><br>Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/RenderATL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RenderATL</a>!<br><br>This experience was everything I hoped it would be and more. 🍑💪🏼<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RenderATL23?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RenderATL23</a> <a href="https://t.co/voyUQ8EneN">pic.twitter.com/voyUQ8EneN</a></p>&mdash; Anna Nettles (@_annanettles) <a href="https://twitter.com/_annanettles/status/1664843539274932228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## The People

I didn't get to meet him, but I couldn't agree more with Tejas in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/TejasKumar_/status/1664616910669991939?s=20) that "the people are truly my favorite part of any conference!!" There was so much joy and energy in the crowd, it was almost intoxicating. 

I was very much looking forward to seeing people like [Chris](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier), [Homer](https://twitter.com/xirclebox), [Jina](https://twitter.com/jina), and [Sarah](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) who I hadn't for a few years. My last conference was in October of 2019, which feels like forever ago. There were some surprises as well, like running into [Keith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brand180) from the #frontendconf days and randomly seeing [Jared](https://twitter.com/jponch) at a brewery unrelated to the conf. 

I met a bunch of new folks that I'll be looking forward to seeing at future events as well. There's too many to list out, but I wanted to give an extra thanks to [Domitrius](https://twitter.com/domitriusclark) for being so welcoming and to [Keegan](https://twitter.com/keegandonley) for an awesome chat and sharing a Bluesky invite.

I'll wrap this up with some tweets from other folks sharing how wonderful this event was.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shout out to Justin and the entire <a href="https://twitter.com/RenderATL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RenderATL</a> crew.
