<small>Two of my favorite people [Carl Smith](https://twitter.com/carlsmith) and [Andi Graham](https://twitter.com/andigrahambsd), who are always giving back to the community.</small>

Some wonderful got together and made us an [awesome site](http://frontendthanks.com) and printed off t-shirts. Thank you again to everyone involved and specifically to [Matt Graham](https://twitter.com/michigangraham) and [Ben Callahan](https://twitter.com/bencallahan) for heading things up. They also donated the proceeds from Cotton Bureau to us. Needless to say, we never planned on pocketing that.

## Giving It Back

There's an awesome opportunity to give back in a couple of ways. We really want this project to get funded: [CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/code-debugging-the-gender-gap). Additionally, one of the rewards gets someone 6 months of [Code School](http:codeschool.com). I love working there and the idea of someone getting 6 months to increase their skills.

So, we bought 2 of the \$100 levels where someone gets the Code School reward and I want to give the rewards away.

## We Need Your Help

##### Step one:

We need to know who to give these 2 rewards to. Are you in a point in your career where this could really make a difference? Or, do you know someone that it could really make a difference to? Pop your or their name in the form below and I'll do a random draw on Friday (October 10th).

##### Step two:

[Share the project!](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/code-debugging-the-gender-gap) It has 4 days left and only needs \$1,750 (at this moment).

#### Congratulations to Fasina and Ryan, our winners!
