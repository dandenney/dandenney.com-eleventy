Another one from Thomas Keller's Master Class, this is close to his [technique for glazing carrots](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/thomas-keller-teaches-cooking-techniques/chapters/glazing-carrots). They were delicous! I also made a video of the process, which included making some sauce vierge.
