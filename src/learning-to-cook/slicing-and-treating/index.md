One thing that I've noticed in all of the classes that I've taken is that meat is often sliced before serving. I've started to try this and I like it for a few reasons: it looks more appealing and it's better for seasoning. For this one, I used some finishing salt and drizzled some of the butter that I used for searing.

## What to Improve

I should take a little more time to arrange them, to allow for more of the finishing salt and to improve the appearance. Plus, I'd like to go further with the sauces and some herbs.
