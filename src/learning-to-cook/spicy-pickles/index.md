Another [technique from Thomas Keller's Master Class](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/thomas-keller-teaches-cooking-techniques/chapters/pickling) that I wanted to try. I've found some delicious spicy pickles on trips and love to add them to my scrambled eggs. This concoction was a few cucumbers, habaneros, garlic, thyme, vinegar, and water.

## What to Improve

The spice was fantastic, but I packed the jar weirdly, so it's been a pain in the ass to get the pickles out. Next time, I'll pack it better and add some onions.
