I've wanted to try this for a couple of years since I first saw Ben Callahan's [pics on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BLWbgj1AsbM/). On Easter, a friend brought a smoked prime rib, and I pulled the trigger on ordering one. Today was my first crack at it, and I cut my teeth with some salmon.

## What to Improve

I need to learn how to control the heat. For today, it was perfect. The salmon was delicious, and it was done in under an hour. To get it right for brisket, though, I need that long, slow, cook. I'll do some more reading and video watching so that I can do a brisket next weekend.

## Lights, Camera, Action
