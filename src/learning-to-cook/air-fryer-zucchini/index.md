Thomas Keller shared [a technique for roasting zucchini](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-roast-zucchini-in-the-oven-with-thomas-keller#recipe-oven-roasted-zucchini) in his Master Class. I wanted to take a crack at it in the air fryer, to see how it would compare. For this round, I cooked them at 400Â° for about 12 minutes, trying 7 at first and then doing another 5.

## What to Improve

I seasoned them with olive oil, black pepper, and sea salt, but they weren't salty enough for me. Next time, I'll do a thin layer of kosher salt and then maybe some sea salt for the crunch. They were very tender and the consistency was good, but I want more brown. Next time I'll probably cook them for 20 minutes or so.
