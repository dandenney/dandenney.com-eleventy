I've [done this before](/blips/i-missed-rss/), but I'm back on Feedly. Louis Lazaris shared an OPML and his huge list of front-end related RSS feeds. I'm diving back in, to try to curb my social media addiction during this pandemic. I'm hoping that I'll reach for this feed and learn a bunch instead of constantly reading Twitter while everyone freaks out.
