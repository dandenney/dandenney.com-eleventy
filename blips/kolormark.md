I came across this fun idea today, [Kolormark](https://kolormark.com), where they're selling the ability to name all of the hex values of colors. I love finding names of colors for variables in code, and this seemed cool. The crazy thing is if my math is right, they've generated \$2M so far, and that makes me question my life choices.

Of course, I had to have one, so `#b51f24` is now officially "Front-end Conf". [Proof](https://kolormark.com/b51f24)
